_Because I hate electron apps!_<br/>
I hate using electron apps. They always clog up my system, eat up all my RAM and basically make my experience horible.
But its a good thing that all these electron apps have a web based app as well.<br/>
But the problem with these web apps is that they take unnecessary tab space. Therefore when having like >10 tabs, its hard to manage the web app as a tab, especially if its a utility app like spotify.<br/>

So my solution is to pop out the web app into a new minimal browser window. That is excatly what _popify_ does
